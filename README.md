# I2C

**I2C (Image to communicate)** is an application to enable people to communicate
via eye movements using images.

## Project Vision / Elevator Pitch

With the help of **I2C** a possibility is to be offered to establish a
communication over pictures by eye movement. For this purpose a table-like
structure is used, in which e.g. 8 pictures are shown on a screen, by eye
movement for example to the left the 4 pictures on the left side of the screen
are selected and distributed on the screen, this can be repeated until the
suitable picture was selected. This is intended to serve as a communication
interface for people who can neither speak nor read, but can recognize images.
The goal is to provide a simple and time and nerve saving solution for the
person preparing the app.

There are already solutions for people who can use writing as a means of
communication, but no equivalent interface for the use of images.

## Project background / initial situation
    
This project is started because there are no practicable solutions for this kind
of communication so far. This is intended to provide non-verbal communication 
using images.

- Woran wird die Zielerreichung erkannt?

## Benefits

Through the project, better communication can be enabled for people who can only
communicate through images and for whom it is easier to control with the eyes
than, for example, with switches. Furthermore, the goal is that no additional
hardware is needed, except for a smartphone/tablet. The project is also intended
to be open-source, so that no expensive proprietary software needs to be
purchased.
